            </div>
            <p>General information about being a chat moderator. What is a Chat Moderator?</p>
            <p>Your main work task as a chat operator is to answer messages on our platform. The messages are received from various websites. Customers get on these websites for stimulating conversations and/or to make their fantasies come true, talk about them or share them.</p>
            <p>Our customers are looking for entertainment and your messages and replies must make that possible.</p>
            <p>We, as chat operators, want to give the customers a good time and an exciting experience on the site, we will create happiness. The better and more interesting your messages are, the sooner the customer will come back and give more opportunities to earn more!</p>
            <p>Your goal should be to answer as many messages as possible and with the best possible quality to keep the conversations alive so that customers are returning and continue to write messages.</p>
            <p>Working time and work routine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You log in and work when you want and how long you want at a time.</li>
                <li>Worth mentioning again is that if you are working for a while, the system automatically sends back customers to you that you previously messaged with, so it gets easier/faster to work. Fewer messages to read through and you don't have to study the profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are two tips, High Quality Generates a Higher Income and Play Your Role and Play It Well, on how you can and should act and what our expectations are of you. This is our way of making sure that our working relationship is a fruitful and lasting one and that our customer's experience is always the top concern.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 column-border">
                    <h3>HIGH QUALITY GENERATES A HIGHER INCOME</h3>
                    <p>When you have a good conversation with a customer, our system automatically keeps sending you this customer's response, instead of assigning them to another operator. This is also assuming that both of you are logged in simultaneously.
                    By keeping high quality and getting recurring conversations, your work will be both easier and faster because you then do not have to spend as much time reading through previous notes and messages, but can easily just continue the conversation where you left it a short while ago. In other words, this makes it easier for you to answer and make more money.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 column-border">
                    <h3>PLAY YOUR ROLE AND PLAY IT WELL</h3>
                    <p>The chat operator's job is a combination of being a creative writer and an actor. A good operator is able to adjust his or her way of writing and overall expression so that it matches the player profile that has been assigned in the conversation.
                    It is important to be able to align writing to that of the customers writing and wishes. A 50-year-old woman expresses herself differently from a 20-year-old girl. It is important to keep this in mind when writing messages. Pay attention to the player's profile.</p>

                <h2>OUR KEY RULES</h2>
                <img src="https://keyrules.interfacechatcloud.fun/key.jpg" alt="Our Key Rules" class="session-image">
            </div>
            <p>Here are our key rules that you must know and follow closely!</p>
            <p>Step 1: NEVER reveal your real name or other details about yourself.</p>
            <p>We guarantee that your identity will never be revealed and expect the same from you.</p>
            <p>Step 2: NEVER suggest and/or accept other contact methods than our platform.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The customer will suggest other ways of contact to avoid paying. For example e-mail, phone, Kik, Facebook, Skype, Snapchat.</li>
                <li>Your job as an operator is to motivate and retain the customer on our platform. Say that you feel more comfortable using this site when it comes to adult dating, it feels more professional and serious.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Step 3: NEVER EVER suggest and/or accept to receive money or another form of gift/compensation from the customer.</p>
            <p>To agree to or propose financial compensation or another type of compensation is strictly forbidden.</p>
            <p>Step 4: You may NEVER, and under NO CIRCUMSTANCES whatsoever, encourage, accept or make any suggestions on physical dates.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our customers pay for fantasy and hope to meet the perfect woman. Sooner or later, the customer will propose a date to meet in person and will want you to agree on a time for this to happen. As an operator, it is your responsibility to talk your way out of it since this will NEVER happen.</li>
                <li>It is important that our operators never mislead customers. We assume that customers know that they are chatting with entertainment profiles since they clicked on several announcements.</li>
                <li>As an operator, you should NEVER introduce the idea of meeting or being the first in the conversation to mention it.</li>
                <li>You as an operator should NEVER give concrete suggestions and/or answers to where, when, and how you can meet.</li>
                <li>You must NEVER accept or confirm a specific time or place.</li>
                <li>When the customer brings up a physical meeting in the conversation, you can answer that you are interested in meeting him without proposing or agreeing to any meeting. (that sounds nice, I am interested, etc.)</li>

            </div>
            <p>It is very important to adapt your way of writing to the customer's profile.</p>
            <p>The people we write with are unique individuals with various interests, desires, and needs. We must be able to identify what the customer is looking for and adapt our responses to meet those expectations.</p>
            <p>It is crucial to understand that some customers want a serious and deep conversation while others are looking for a fantasy or a role play scenario.</p>
            <p>The customer profiles vary and you must be able to adapt to the customer's needs and desires to tailor your responses to their needs and preferences.</p>
            <p>Step 1: Identify the customer's needs and desires.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the customer looking for a deep conversation, fantasy, or just a casual chat?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Step 2: Adjust your responses based on the customer's profile and messages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay attention to the customer's age, gender, and preferences to tailor your responses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Step 3: Maintain professionalism and respect at all times.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always be polite, respectful, and considerate, even if the customer is not.</li>

            <p>The most frustrating thing for a customer is the feeling of not being taken seriously. Therefore, never ask for information about something the customer already has in their profile or information already written in the notepad.</p>
            <p>This is why it is essential to make good use of the notepad!</p>
            <p>If you save the relevant information, operators will then have access to what you have saved.</p>

            <p>Messages are charged at €0.010 per message, regardless of the number of messages. Payments are made weekly, every Monday, via Binance or Perfect Money.</p>
            <p>After completing the training, you will receive access to the account to experiment with the first 25 messages for free. After the experimentation period, you must go to the operator's portal to activate your account with a subscription fee of €30. Without this subscription, you will not be able to continue using the account.</p>
            <p>The €30 subscription is a contribution towards advertising to attract customers, so you can continue finding clients to chat with and get paid.</p>
            <p>If you violate any rules and your account gets deactivated, you can reactivate it by paying €30 through the operator's portal.</p>
